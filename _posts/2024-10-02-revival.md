Welcome (again)! 

It's the time of the year when students are let out of the dungeons of Oxford and free to roam around again. With more time on my hands now, I think the time is right to actually start posting instead of only thinking about posting. 

As I have now finished my first year of Oxford and come back from Nairobi, my brain is filled to the brim with thoughts I didn't have time to write down and document in the heat of the moment. The year passed by like a blur and I think I also owe it to myself to reflect on what I have done this past year before I get swamped by the new school year.

As part of the rebranding, I am also finally giving my blog a name, something long overdue. I've settled on *Piece of Mind*. 

This will become a space where for me to jolt down the internal monologue that runs through my head, offering a glimpse into my inner workings. The title is also a play on the phrase "Peace of Mind." I've always found myself looking back, reliving conversation and wishing I had mentioned some point. Being able to share my blog keeps my coherent thoughts in one place and relieves my anxiety of not being clear. 


Stay Tuned!

@Elon Musk, NeuroLink when? I want to be able to record my thoughts as they pass through my brain when i want to and then synthesis it later.
Shower thoughts, bedside thoughts. This is why many writers reccomend keeping a bedside notebook. 
I find it bad as you end up finetunning your brain so it doesnt shut down to sleep. The upside is you get a lot more ideas to use tomorrow morning.  -->
