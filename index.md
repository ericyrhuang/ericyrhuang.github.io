# *What's left after thoughts race by? <br> After words spoken fade in the air?*


I've always found myself wishing to put my thoughts in words, and words on paper; to capture them like a genie in a bottle, freeze them in time, for both myself and the world. 


The essays here are an attempt at that, to elucidate what's stuck in my head, all the ideas worth sharing. This blog is a piece of my mind, a small slice of my thoughts, knowledge, and joys â€” all that make up me. 


I present to you: *Piece of Mind*.
