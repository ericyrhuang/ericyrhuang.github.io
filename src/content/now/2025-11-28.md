it's stunning in Oxford now.

I'm back for the last year of my degree--it's so hard to believe. This term has been slower, and I've enjoyed it!

Being forced to stare into the abyss that is graduation has made me reconsider what I want to gain from Oxford. I realized intellectually, math is something I'm good enough at now for me to transition to autodidadic. I know pure math is something I want to keep in my life forever and the only way is to learn how to read math textbooks by myself. And slowely I'm building up the confidence. I've also picked up a number of more humanities hobbies like improv, and somehow begged my way into tutorials in Buddhist metaphysics for next term. 

Since the start of the term, I've lived in Babel, a group house with my friends that started with us doing sleepovers in the CS department for AIRO. We host board games [Sunday 8pm](https://babel.house/events) so come along if you're in town! We're also happy to host visitors from around if you ever need a place in Oxford.
