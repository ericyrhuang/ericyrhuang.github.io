> Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, 'How did he do it? He must be a genius! ― Gian-Carlo Rota, Indiscrete Thoughts

### Intelligence Research:
- what is the correct incentive structure for RL on LLMs to explore instead of exploit?
    - a concrete benchmark is generating diverse, novel, interesting mathematical conjectures
- is novelty a continuous or discontinous process?
    - if an LLM had the full context of Einstein's brain in Jan 1915 would it be able to write down the EFE? 
- does the integration of open-endedness into transformer based LRMs require new architectures?
- how does alignment originate in multi-agent systems such as societies?

### Other research: 
- what are the major attacks on the non-foundational metaphysics posed by Madyamaka buddhism and can formalization via higher order metaphysics cut through this? 
- how can one formulate a philosophical basis for each of the two major US political parties grounded in Christian theology?
    - Roughly 75% of Republicans and 65% of Democrats are Christian in the US so an argument relying on Miracles (eg Butler, PA) may be under-utilized relative to reason in certain areas.
- what does Economic transformative AI (TAI) look like for developing countries? 
    - A small niche of literature has emerged of models of developed nations under TAI, little has been written on developing countries. 
    - In turn, how does this shape the action space of these nations and what economic infrastructure can be built in SSA so that this goes as well as possible?
