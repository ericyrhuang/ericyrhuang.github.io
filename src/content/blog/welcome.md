This is my first blog post written in Markdown. Astro will automatically render this into a beautiful blog post page.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in Markdown with frontmatter
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks are automatically highlighted
- **Type Safety**: Content collections provide full TypeScript support

## Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greeting('World'));
```

## What's Next

I'm excited to share more content soon! This website features:

- A custom cursor effect inspired by hummingbird.vc
- Minimal, elegant design with centered layout
- Fast performance thanks to Astro's static generation
- Smooth transitions and responsive design

Stay tuned for more posts about technology, projects, and ideas.
