## Hello!

I am planning on posting here some musings and reflections that I hope would be beneficial for future me and others to read.
From time to time I may also post some more technical articles on math or cs related topics that I am exporing.

The purpose of this website is two-fold. It serves as a place for me to keep in one place all my documents, links, and points of contact.
It's also a platform for me to practice and improve my writing skills, both creative and expository,
and in the process hopefully spread ideas worth sharing.
The posting schedule will be far from regular but I'll try to write whenever I have some inspirations or trains of thought.

See you around!

Eric
